# tetris


It is a small project I am working on with my brother

I am using Visual Studio Code

My problem is with the audio. I run the game with three commands :

    make clean
    make
    ./tetris

Whenever i run the game i get this error message can someone fix that :

Failed to open sound file "src/Tetris.ogg" (format not supported)
